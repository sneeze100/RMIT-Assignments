<p>Interesting Fact: One interesting fact that I am proud of now that I have had a chance to look back and reflect on it, was during my Royal Navy career that I was part of the build and commissioning crew of HMS Astute. This was an important time in my submarine career, this opportunity allowed me to work with new technologies (at the time) that are now commonplace in submarine design, being a Sonar operator I was privileged to take the biggest computer ever to go to sea in the world at the time, this computer was what ran the Sonar system 2076 and is currently a world leader Sonar systems</p>  
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p>I have always had a rudimentary interest in IT, been born in 1978 I grew up with IT equipment evolving from the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, Atari ST, and then the slow progression up the PC ladder up to my current gaming rig. Having the opportunity to work as a Sonar operator on new technologically advanced weapon systems has also piqued my interest and I have always wanted to know how the background systems and operating systems come together and work seamlessly, from rudimentary computers to blade servers, and the natural progression for militaries to adopt of the shelf technology as the hardware technology progresses so fast.</p>
<h2> Why RMIT </h2>
<p> I will be honest here, RMIT was sold to me by Open University and so far, I am happy with the user interface and the instructional staff. </h2>
<h2> Expectations</h2>
<p> I am expecting to learn more about IT academia and the opportunities that it will bring me in my pursuit to gain a degree in IT. I understand that IT casts a wide net of different disciplines, and I would like to know as much as i can about all of them.</p>

<h2> A description (in your own words) of the position, and particulary what makes the position appealing to you.</h2>
<p> The position I have selected is a company that works with cloud-based servers, this job would require me to utilise the skill set that I will hopefully be learning during my journey through this degree of IT from RMIT, and also use a skill set that I have already acquired in my working life to date, that is the management of people and deconflicting work schedules and the ability to work with stakeholders and customers. The reason that this position appeals to me is the fact that it is a work-from-home position, this would suit me at the moment due to where I am at in my life, with consistently working away from home without communication and missing my children growing up, I would be able to make the most of my children and missed opportunities that I have missed.</p>
<h2> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experiance required for the position.</h2>
<p>  The qualifications that I will need for this position would be a degree in IT with extensive CLI experience with Linux at a technical level, also a very high level of knowledge in the operation of OpenStack, Public Cloud, and Virtualisation technologies, also a firm handle on the management of people and the planning of schedules, also the learning of another language would be desirable for this position as well.</p>
<h2> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications, and experiences you currently have.</h2>
<p> I currently do not have the technical knowledge or skills to complete this role successfully, but I do have a solid foundation in the management of people and equipment that could be used in any workforce. </h2>
<h2> A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.</h2>
<p> My plan to gain the required skills is to complete the current degree work that I intend to complete, also the ability to complete volunteer work with companies such as Thales and other military contractors will stand me in good standing.</p>

<h2> Myers-Brigg test</h2>

<h2>What do the results mean for you ?</h2>
<p> This result has shown me many traits that I do display and many that I will need to watch as I work in a team environment. When I get absorbed in a project or deadline at work I get energetic and strong-willed to get the task complete.</p>
<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h2>
<p>I think the ability to critically think and be strong-willed to get the task completed will be a benefit to any group that I am added to. I also think of myself of been semi charismatic and inspiring when needed to be.</p>
<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>I will need to take into account members' feelings and emotions, and not minimise members' feelings as this will make members feel as if their contribution is not valued.</p>

<h2>What do the results mean for you ?</h2>
<p>The test results have given me an insight into learning methods that best work for me, from Visual learning, Kinesthetics, and finally Auditory learning, I think these learning categories will work well for me during this module as a lot of the course content seems to be modeled around these methods.</p>
<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h2>
<p>I think seeing others' contributions will give me an understanding of how other people have gone about their thought processes and may give me ideas on how to display content so that I will be a more effective member of the team.</p>
<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>This is a hard one to answer as I do not think my learning methods will affect the group, the only way I could see it affecting the group is by the possibility of slowing down the work pace.</p>
