<p>Interesting Fact: One interesting fact that I am proud of now that I have had a chance to look back and reflect on. During my career in the Royal Navy, for a certain period was part of the build and commissioning of HMS Astute. Being able to watch parts of HMS Ambush being rolled into the yard and all the parts being assembled and then welded together showed the awesome amount of technology and design skills coming together to produce one of the most advanced submarines in the world come together, I used to look back at this as a low point in my life due to work-life balance but as I get older I think back to the days with fond memories of all the friends I made and all the good times and firsts we had during the initial trial periods of HMS Astute.</p>  
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p>I have always had a rudimentary interest in IT, been born in 1978 I grew up with IT equipment evolving from the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, Atari ST, and then the slow progression of the PC ladder up to my current gaming rig. Since joining the Navy in 1997 I have had the opportunity to work with new technologically advanced Sonar systems that have been developed by the Royal Navy, which piqued my interest in the software that ran the systems that we were using and the hardware that it was been run on, I have seen dedicated Sonar systems that have been designed purposely to run solely and then to off the shelf or as it is commonly known in military circles as Commercial Of the Shelf (COTS). Never believing in myself in the ability to learn a new skill or start on a journey to gain a degree I have come to the age where I want to learn more about IT and this course will hopefully catch my interest and start a side hustle in IT.</p>
<h2> Why RMIT </h2>
<p>I will be honest here, RMIT was sold to me by Open University and so far, I am happy with the user interface and the instructional staff.</p>
<h2> Expectations</h2>
<p>I am expecting to learn more about IT academia and the opportunities that it will bring me in my pursuit to gain an IT degree. I understand that IT casts a wide net of different disciplines, and I would like to know as much as I can about all of them so I can make a more informed decision as I progress to make the right decisions on future modules.</p>

<h2> A description (in your own words) of the position, and particulary what makes the position appealing to you.</h2>
<p>The position I have selected is at Canonical as an OpenStack Technical Support Manager, this company works within the cloud using such things as cloud-based servers. This job would require me to utilise the skill set that I will hopefully gain during my learning journey through this degree from RMIT, also the ability to use my skill set that I have acquired in my working life to date, the management of people with the ability to deconflicting working schedules and the ability to work with stakeholders and customers whilst under pressure. </p>
<p>The reason this position appeals to me is the fact that it is a work-from-home position, this would suit me due to where I am currently at in my life, with consistently working away from home since 1997 and having the ability to become a bit of a home bird would be good where I can spend time not only concentrating on work but my family also, when I want to start work the salary will not be a big part as I will have my pension and income from properties to subsides my life.</p>
<h2> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experiance required for the position.</h2>
<p>The qualifications that I will need for this position would be a degree in IT with extensive CLI experience and Linux at a technical level, a very high level of knowledge in the operation of OpenStack, Public Cloud, and Virtualisation technologies, a firm handle on the management of people and planning schedules, and the possibility of learning of another language would also be desirable for this position as well.</p>

<h2> A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.</h2>
<p>My plan to gain the required skills is to complete the current degree in IT that I have started, I will also try and complete volunteer work with companies such as Thales and other military contractors that should stand me in good standing.</p>

<h2>What do the results mean for you ?</h2>
<p>This result has shown me many traits that I do display and many that I will need to watch as I work in a team environment. When I get absorbed in a project or deadline at work I get energetic and strong-willed to get the task complete, this strong-willed trait will also come at a negative where I usually become stubborn and cold when it comes to decision making, I understand that this is not popular and it can put peoples noses out of shape.</p>
<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h2>
<p>I think the ability to critically think and be strong-willed to get the task completed will be a benefit to any group that I am added to. I also think of myself of been semi charismatic and inspiring when needed to be. One downside would be the ability to upset people whilst being stubborn, I will need to keep check of myself and think before I speak to make sure what I say does not upset or push people away.</p>
<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>I will need to take into account members' feelings and emotions, and not minimize members' feelings as this will make members feel as if their contribution is not valued. The last thing I want to do is belittle people but sometimes it can just sneak out, and if it does I will need to recognize what I have done and apologize after the fact.</p>

<h2>What do the results mean for you ?</h2>
<p>The test results have given me an insight into the learning methods that best work for me, from Visual learning, Kinesthetics, and finally Auditory learning, I think these learning categories will work well for me during this module as a lot of the course content seems to be modeled around these methods.</p>
<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h2>
<p>I think seeing others' contributions will give me an understanding of how other people have gone about their thought processes and learning journey this may give me ideas on how to display content so that I will be a more effective team member, and hopefully I will be able to contribute to members learning as well.</p>
<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>This is a hard one to answer as I do not think my learning methods will affect the group, the only way I could see it affecting the group is by the possibility of slowing down the work pace.</p>

<h2>What do the results mean for you ?</h2>
<p>The results have told me what I already knew about myself, after having been in the military for nearly 25 years I have become very ridged with policy and traditions.</p>
<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h2>
<p>I think this test would suggest that I could be a little argumentative but I will also have emotional stability, I also like organisation with deadlines and work schedules.</p>
<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>I will have to take into account other people's feelings as I work in a group so I will have to remain cognisant of their feelings as I donâ€™t care about other people's feelings and with the way the world is I will have to be careful.</p>
<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h2> Overview<h/2>
<p>The Project idea that I have decided to work on is a phone-based application that can scan groceries as you add them to your shopping trolley or shopping basket, this application would be designed for all mainstream supermarkets and would be in the same vain as self-service checkouts, imagine the ease of putting your bags into the shopping trolley and the ability to play shopping trolley Tetris without having to unpack it for the cashier or the self-service check out and the only time you need to unpack is when you get home.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The motivation behind this application is due to the way supermarkets are starting to reduce their pay roles and making you use self-checkout more often than not due to them not opening cashier lanes for their customers, also the benefit of being able to handle the products once during your shopping experience allows you to pack your bags the way you want to only once. Also, the ability to reduce your shopping bill by using available coupons found on the internet, and noting that prices at the moment seem to keep going up the benefit of reducing family's shopping costs are a driving factor.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This new shopping experience application will be a one-stop shopping application and will be modern in appearance and also free from advertisements, the application will ask for permission to use your camera function, which will allow for the scanning of barcodes and QR codes for each item. The application will draw on the payment option like apple pay and google pay that you have your phone already set to, with a small price tag of zero dollars you will be able to purchase a shopping trolley scale that will connect to your phone via Bluetooth, this will allow the purchaser to scan fresh food that is normally weighed and allow the weighing scale in the bottom of your trolley to work out the weight of the product as you add it to your trolley.</P>
<p>Another feature of the application will be the function to use the required supermarket rewards card account and also the ability to search the internet for additional coupons. This function will allow shoppers to reduce their overall shopping bills. Another application is the ability to take a stocktake of your current pantry goods and chilled goods, with the integration of a menu function it will automatically tell you what products you need to purchase to make each meal on your menu.
 The shopping application will have the ability to remember your last shopping haul and will be able to make suggestions to add to your shopping trolley whilst you are shopping, this function will allow you to broaden your horizons on items that you are purchasing. The application will allow you to conduct your shopping from the comfort of your own home by having a clean and user-friendly user interface, this will move away from the clunky displays that are currently on offer.</p>
<p>So the supermarket does not lose out to shoplifting the weighing mat will keep track of all items to measure the known weights of standard products that are purchased every day also taking into account the weight of fresh produce, the application will have two-factor authentication for the purchase of fresh produce, the scanning of the fresh produce code and recognition software that will require a photograph of the item to confirm it is what you say it is before self-deleting off your phone to save memory space on your device.</p> 
<p>the application will have additional security by utilizing biometric data and a PIN this will protect your account and stop any malicious purchasing from people that steal your phone or try and hack your account, every endeavor will be taken to protect your personal information with strict adherence to privacy laws.</P>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>The tools I will use to develop this application will be Xcode 14 and Eclipse for Android Developers these programs provide everything you need to create an application for IOS and Android. And because of my limited knowledge, I will also use a how-to guide on how to program a barcode scan application. The shopping application will be made using a shopping application guide.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If this project is successful it will allow you to skip the dreaded self-service check out, where you technically do the check out operator job yourself. The application will allow you to conduct the self-serve function but it will become seamless as you will be scanning as you are packing your bags in the shopping trolley. I am sure if this application works as detailed supermarkets will look favorable at this technology as it will reduce the financial cost on the payroll.</p>
